# ToDo Web Application

This is a ToDo Web Application through React and Vite. This ToDo application allows users to add tasks to this application to keep track of tasks the user needs to finish. All of these tasks are stored in local memory, allowing these tasks to be saved locally and have their tasks still saved, even if refreshing the web application or leaving the web application. The user is allowed to add tags to these tasks to classify what type of task it is, and the user can place this task into certain categories of completion, such as starting, in progress, and finished. If a user finishes a task, they can delete the task permanently from local memory. The entire front end of this web application is created through CSS and HTML.

**Example Use of this Application:**
